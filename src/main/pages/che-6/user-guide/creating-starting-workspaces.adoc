== Creating workspaces

The easiest way to create a workspace is to use predefined link:stacks.html[stacks] in the *User Dashboard*.  The images and configuration in these stacks are for Docker and OpenShift.  The predefined stacks are used in daily functional testing. The following are examples of ways to create a workspace:

*Use Predefined stacks*

*Duplicate an existing stack*

In this scenario, you need to create a stack first, and then use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

*Create a custom stack from a custom link:recipes.html[recipe]*

In this scenario, you need to author a custom link:recipes.html[recipe], then a stack, and finally use the resulting stack to create a workspace.

== Starting workspaces

A workspace can be started in one of the following ways:

1.  Auto-start when the workspace is created in the *User Dashboard*.
2.  Click the Run or Open buttons in the workspace details view in the *User Dashboard*.
3.  Click on a workspace name in the left Dashboard sidebar (recent workspaces)
4.  Use REST API. See link:rest-api.html[REST API] documentation

It can take some time for a workspace environment to start. It depends on several factors like network conditions, Docker image availability, configured installers that may attempt to install additional tools and software in runtime etc. When a workspace is starting, you can track progress in a workspace start tab. There are also individual tabs for each machine in workspace environment that stream logs from installers (terminal, exec agent, ws agent, language servers if any).

== Workspace Management

Once a workspace is created or started, you can modify it by adding link:projects.html[projects], link:installers.html[installers], link:env-variables.html[env variables], link:volumes.html[volumes]. You can also edit raw workspace configuration, but beware that you may break your workspace this way, so always have a backup of a working configuration. If you change the configuration of a running workspace and save it, a workspace will be restarted. Follow the links above to learn more about workspace configuration.
